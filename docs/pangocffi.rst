pangocffi
=========

pangocffi is a `CFFI`_-based set of Python bindings for pango_.

pangocffi on its own is not that useful, since it depends on a PangoFontMap
being declared against the PangoContext.
PangoFontMap instances can easily be retrieved from libraries such as
PangoCairo, PangoXft, PangoFT2, and PangoWin32 (See gnome's documentation
`'Rendering with Pango'`_ for a list of rendering engines).

See pangocairocffi_ for bindings that allow you to render pango objects with
cairo.

The bindings are currently not fully implemented. Feel free to make a pull
request to contribute!
